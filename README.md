# 2022-022 - An Intelligent Automated-based Secure Personalized Healthcare Platform Using IoT-Cloud Based Technologies

## Main Objective
The main objective of our Remote portable personalized healthcare platform for patients is to implement a remote portable personalized health care platform for remote patients. The IoT (Internet of Things) based systems are equipped with body sensor networks within telemedicine systems. They include devices with a special type of nodes that sense periodic differences of patient data.. In our implementation that makes it easier to monitor the patient health by sending information to healthcare teams such as a doctor, nurses, and specialists through IoT (Internet of things) and web technologies, as well as we, are adding a machine learning platform based alerting system to identify the critical health problems. It would be helpful for professionals to save and gather patient data using the store-and-forward method so that it is accessible at any time. By implementing Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AL) based alerting system that allows alerting Patient Guardian, Doctor and Medical Staff when the unnecessary event occurred.

## Main Research Question
Medical officers have been unable to keep patients with long term illnesses in health care centres because of the growing world of technology. People forget their help check-up which needs to be done monthly or quarterly. Some patients need to be continuously monitored their health matrices, but due to the current situation doctors are unable to monitor continuously. If the Doctors can contribute patient data and diagnosis information to a massive database accessible to physicians in our organization. Centralized health data can be used to identify new diseases and patterns more quickly. And the current situation there is no solution for centralized storing the health metrics in one place. And these centralized health data can be used to identify new diseases and patterns more quickly. Due to the lack of manpower in the medical sector unable to continuously monitor individual patients and there is no proper mechanism to alert emergency health situations based on machine learning algorithms.

## Individual Research Question
